This is a totally wicked looking dagger.  It's got awesome barbs on the back
of the blade, a compass on the hilt, and myriad other embellishments that
serve no functional purpose.  You could totally be a deadly assassin with a
sweet blade like this.  Since it's so light, it won't encumber you.  It's
made out of polyurethane foam.
