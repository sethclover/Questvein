MONSTER DESCRIPTION

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Junior Barbarian
SYMB p
COLOR YELLOW
DESC
This is a junior barbarian.  He--or is it she?  You can't tell for sure--
looks like... it should still be in barbarian school.  The barbarians are 
putting them in the dungeons young these days.  It's wearing dirty, tattered
cloth armor and wielding a wooden sword.  You have a hard time feeling
intimidated.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Amazon Lich Queen
DESC
She was a powerful Amazon warrior in life.  Death at the hands of the undead
hordes was followed by her resurrection through dark, necromantic arts.  Her
power in life didn't approach her undead glory.  Clad in night-black robes
that don't move in the wind, her incorporeal form commands the power of death
over life.  You may just be her next victim.  You fear for your soul as you
quake before her malevolent majesty.

NAME Titan
DESC
Looming over you at a massive 15 feet tall, weighing nearly a ton, the
Titan is a force to be reckoned with. A mighty oak club is his weapon of
choice, but you are all too aware it would take no more than a flick of
the wrist for him to shatter every bone in your body.

NAME Rory Gilmore
DESC
All decked out in a brand new Chilton uniform, she talks faster than anybody
you've ever known.  She's dual-wielding Proust's "Rememberance of Things
Past" and a half-empty coffee cup; you'd better watch out or she'll hit you
with a litany of cultural references from which you'll never recover.

Casper, the friendly ghost, 
The friendliest ghost you know. 
Though grown-ups might 
Look at him with fright, 
The children all love him so. 

He always says hello, 
and he's really glad to meetcha. 
Wherever he may go, 
He's kind to every living creature. 

Grown-ups don't understand 
Why children love him the most. 
But kids all know 
That he loves them so, 
Casper the friendly ghost.

NAME David Bowie
DESC
He was the human equivalent of a Google search, a portal through which you
could step into an amazing, very different wider world. He flooded plain
everyday reality with extraordinary, unexpected information, processing the
details through a buoyant, mobile mind and made intellectual discovery seem
incredibly glamorous.

NAME SpongeBob SquarePants
DESC
  "Are you ready, kids?!?!"
  "I can't hear you!"

He lives in a pineapple under the sea.  He's enormous and yellow and porous.
And he's tired of flipping Krabby Patties and playing unofficial sidekick and
the ocean's biggest fan to Mermaid Man.  Each of those billions of pores is
saturated with soaked-up malevolence, and all of it is focused on you.

SpongeBob rules the dungeons of 327.  He'll coat the dungeon floor with your
blood and soak it right up to increase his power.

DESC
Some really old skool tech that might go over your head.  It's kind of like 
Powerpoint, but without computers.  You've probably never seen one before 
(unless you 1) are old; or 2) have taken a music class).  If you get attacked
by one of these, make sure to block high.

better than me, believe me--and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will
build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay
for that wall. Mark my words."
